Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I have been able to use a template to create the css for the web application itself. I have been watching youtube videos along with the sublimental video provided by the professor. I have created a login for the webapplication itself which will allow users to login in order to retreive the information that I will store. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not been able to make it look pretty yet. It is semi functional, but I have not input my customer list yet. I still would like it to show dates of the last time visited, and alert me four weeks prior to their last visit. I have not been able to do that yet. Still figuring out how I would do that.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

So far no problems. Do I think I took on something a little too advanced for me yes a bit, but I will figure it out and do my best.
