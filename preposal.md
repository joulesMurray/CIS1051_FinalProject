# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I was thinking about working the Harvard CS50 Web assignment, I wanted to created my own web application for my barbering buisness.

I also was playing with the idea of creating a discord bot, but I'm not sure of the complexity of that assignment and it may be out of my scope.

I liked the idea of creating a word puzzle game similar to that of a crossword puzzle. Centered around a specific theme.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Working alone

## Do you have any questions of your own?

If I were to go down the route of creating my own web application, is it possible to create a private database that could store private information pertaining to my clientele? Something that would be well organized and allow me to go in and pull from.
